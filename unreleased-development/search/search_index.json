It provides a seamless experience akin to using a single cluster, and it integrates with the tools you're already familiar with, eliminating the need to modify existing resources.</p> <p>KubeStellar is particularly beneficial if you're currently deploying in a single cluster and are looking to expand to multiple clusters, or if you're already using multiple clusters and are seeking a more streamlined developer experience.</p> <p> KubeStellar High Level View </p> <p>The use of multiple clusters offers several advantages, including:</p> <ul> <li>Separation of environments (e.g., development, testing, staging)</li> <li>Isolation of groups, teams, or departments</li> <li>Compliance with enterprise security or data governance requirements</li> <li>Enhanced resiliency, including across different clouds</li> <li>Improved resource availability</li> <li>Access to heterogeneous resources</li> <li>Capability to run applications on the edge, including in disconnected environments</li> </ul> <p>In a single-cluster setup, developers typically access the cluster and deploy Kubernetes objects directly. Without KubeStellar, multiple clusters are usually deployed and configured individually, which can be time-consuming and complex.</p> <p>KubeStellar simplifies this process by allowing developers to define a binding policy between clusters and Kubernetes objects. It then uses your regular single-cluster tooling to deploy and configure each cluster based on these binding policies, making multi-cluster operations as straightforward as managing a single cluster. This approach enhances productivity and efficiency, making KubeStellar a valuable tool in a multi-cluster Kubernetes environment.</p>"},{"location":"readme/#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>We \u2764\ufe0f our contributors!

Thus, in order to add them as Argo CD's 'clusters', there are a few more steps to take.</p> <p>For KubeStellar's Inventory Management Workspace (IMW) and Workload Management Workspace (WMW). The steps are similar. Let's take WMW as an example:</p> <ol> <li>Create `kube-system` namespace in the workspace.</li> <li>Make sure necessary apibindings exist in the workspace.  For WMW, we need one for Kubernetes and one for KubeStellar's edge API.</li> <li>Exclude `ClusterWorkspace` from discovery and sync.  <pre><code>kubectl -n argocd edit cm argocd-cm\n</code></pre>  Make sure `resource.exclusions` exists in the `data` field of the `argocd-cm` configmap as follows: <pre><code>data:\nresource.exclusions: |\n- apiGroups:\n- \"tenancy.kcp.io\"\nkinds:\n- \"ClusterWorkspace\"\nclusters:\n- \"*\"\n</code></pre>  Restart the Argo CD server. <pre><code>kubectl -n argocd rollout restart deployment argocd-server\n</code></pre>  Argo CD's documentation mentions this feature as [Resource Exclusion/Inclusion](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#resource-exclusioninclusion). </li> <li>Make sure the current context uses WMW, then identify the admin.kubeconfig. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd cluster add --name wmw --kubeconfig ./admin.kubeconfig workspace.kcp.io/current\nWARNING: This will create a service account `argocd-manager` on the cluster referenced by context `workspace.kcp.io/current` with full cluster level privileges. Do you want to continue [y/N]? y\nINFO[0001] ServiceAccount \"argocd-manager\" already exists in namespace \"kube-system\"\nINFO[0001] ClusterRole \"argocd-manager-role\" updated\nINFO[0001] ClusterRoleBinding \"argocd-manager-role-binding\" updated\nCluster 'https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:my-org:wmw-turbo' added\n</code></pre>  ### Create Argo CD Applications Once KubeStellar's workspaces are added, Argo CD Applications can be created as normal. There are a few examples listed [here](https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source/tree/main/kubestellar), and the commands to use the examples are listed as follows.  #### Create Argo CD Applications against KubeStellar's IMW Create two Locations. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd app create locations \\\n--repo https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source.git \\\n--path kubestellar/locations/ \\\n--dest-server https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:imw-turbo \\\n--sync-policy automated\napplication 'locations' created\n</code></pre>  Create two SyncTargets. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd app create synctargets \\\n--repo https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source.git \\\n--path kubestellar/synctargets/ \\\n--dest-server https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:imw-turbo \\\n--sync-policy automated\napplication 'synctargets' created\n</code></pre>  #### Create Argo CD Application against KubeStellar's WMW Create a Namespace. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd app create namespace \\\n--repo https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source.git \\\n--path kubestellar/namespaces/ \\\n--dest-server https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:my-org:wmw-turbo \\\n--sync-policy automated\napplication 'namespace' created\n</code></pre>  Create a Deployment for 'cpumemload'. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd app create cpumemload \\\n--repo https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source.git \\\n--path kubestellar/workloads/cpumemload/ \\\n--dest-server https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:my-org:wmw-turbo \\\n--sync-policy automated\napplication 'cpumemload' created\n</code></pre>  Create an EdgePlacement. The command and output should be similar to <pre><code>$ argocd app create edgeplacement \\\n--repo https://github.com/edge-experiments/gitops-source.git \\\n--path kubestellar/placements/ \\\n--dest-server https://172.31.31.125:6443/clusters/root:my-org:wmw-turbo \\\n--sync-policy automated\napplication 'edgeplacement' created\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"Community/partners/argocd/#other-resources","title":"Other Resources","text":"<p>Medium - Sync 10,000 ArgoCD Applications in One Shot Medium - Sync 10,000 ArgoCD Applications in One Shot, by Yourself Medium - GitOpsCon - here we come</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/argocd/#argocd-scale-experiment-kubestellar-community-demo-day","title":"ArgoCD Scale Experiment - KubeStellar Community Demo Day","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/argocd/#gitopscon-2023-a-quantitative-study-on-argo-scalability-andrew-anderson-jun-duan-ibm","title":"GitOpsCon 2023 - A Quantitative Study on Argo Scalability - Andrew Anderson &amp; Jun Duan, IBM","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/argocd/#argocd-and-kubestellar-in-the-news","title":"ArgoCD and KubeStellar in the news","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/fluxcd/","title":"FluxCD","text":"<p>Work with us to create this document</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/kyverno/","title":"Check out KubeStellar working with Kyverno:","text":"<p>Medium - Syncing Objects from one Kubernetes cluster to another Kubernetes cluster</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/kyverno/#kyverno-and-kubestellar-demo-day","title":"Kyverno and KubeStellar Demo Day","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/kyverno/#kyverno-and-kubestellar-in-the-news","title":"Kyverno and KubeStellar in the news","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/kyverno/#how-do-i-get-this-working-with-my-kubestellar-instance","title":"How do I get this working with my KubeStellar instance?","text":"<p>Work with us to create this document</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/mvi/","title":"Check out KubeStellar working with IBM's Maximo Visual Inspection (MVI):","text":"<p>Medium - Deployment and configuration of MVI-Edge using KubeStellar</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/mvi/#mvi-and-kubestellar-demo-day","title":"MVI and KubeStellar Demo Day","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/mvi/#how-do-i-get-this-working-with-my-kubestellar-instance","title":"How do I get this working with my KubeStellar instance?","text":"<p>Work with us to create this document</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/mvi/#mvi-and-kubestellar-in-the-news","title":"MVI and KubeStellar in the news","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/openziti/","title":"OpenZiti","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/turbonomic/","title":"Check out KubeStellar working with Turbonomic:","text":"<p>Medium - Make Multi-Cluster Scheduling a No-Brainer</p>"},{"location":"Community/partners/turbonomic/#turbonomic-and-kubestellar-demo-day","title":"Turbonomic and KubeStellar Demo Day","text":""},{"location":"Community/partners/turbonomic/#how-do-i-get-this-working-with-my-kubestellar-instance","title":"How do I get this working with my KubeStellar instance?","text":"<p>As we can see from the blog and the demo, Turbonomic talks to KubeStellar via GitOps.

It works pretty much like <code>slice</code>     just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the     given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this     is used to fill up missing items. See this example.</p> capitalize function (s) <p>Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others     lowercase.</p> center function (value, width) <p>Centers the value in a field of a given width.</p> count builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> d function (value, default_value, boolean) <p>If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value,     otherwise the value of the variable.</p> default function (value, default_value, boolean) <p>If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value,     otherwise the value of the variable.</p> dictsort function (value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func) <p>Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Python dicts may not     be in the order you want to display them in, so sort them first.</p> e builtin_function_or_method <p>Replace the characters <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>'</code>, and <code>\"</code> in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML.</p> escape builtin_function_or_method <p>Replace the characters <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>'</code>, and <code>\"</code> in the string with HTML-safe sequences. Use this if you need to display text that might contain such characters in HTML.</p> filesizeformat function (value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit) <p>Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB,     4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc).  Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega,     Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to <code>True</code> the binary     prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi).</p> first function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return the first item of a sequence.</p> float function (value, default) <p>Convert the value into a floating point number. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0.0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter.</p> forceescape function (value) <p>Enforce HTML escaping.  This will probably double escape variables.</p> format function (value, args, kwargs) <p>Apply the given values to a <code>printf-style</code>_ format string, like     <code>string % values</code>.</p> groupby function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's     :func:<code>itertools.groupby</code>. The attribute can use dot notation for     nested access, like <code>\"address.city\"</code>. Unlike Python's <code>groupby</code>,     the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each     unique value.</p> indent function (s, width, first, blank, newline, rv, lines) <p>Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The     first line and blank lines are not indented by default.</p> int function (value, default, base) <p>Convert the value into an integer. If the     conversion doesn't work it will return <code>0</code>. You can     override this default using the first parameter. You     can also override the default base (10) in the second     parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as     0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively.     The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values.</p> join function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the     sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per     default, you can define it with the optional parameter.</p> last function (environment, seq) <p>Return the last item of a sequence.</p> length builtin_function_or_method <p>Return the number of items in a container.</p> list function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Convert the value into a list.  If it was a string the returned list     will be a list of characters.</p> lower function (s) <p>Convert a value to lowercase.</p> items function (value) <p>Return an iterator over the <code>(key, value)</code> items of a mapping.</p> map function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute.     This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really     only interested in a certain value of it.</p> min function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the smallest item from the sequence.</p> max function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute) <p>Return the largest item from the sequence.</p> pprint function (value) <p>Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging.</p> random function (context, seq) <p>Return a random item from the sequence.</p> reject function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> rejectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test     succeeding.</p> replace function (eval_ctx, s, old, new, count) <p>Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring     replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring     that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string.     If the optional third argument <code>count</code> is given, only the first     <code>count</code> occurrences are replaced.</p> reverse function (value, rv, e) <p>Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other     way round.</p> round function (value, precision, method, func) <p>Round the number to a given precision. The first     parameter specifies the precision (default is <code>0</code>), the     second the rounding method.</p> safe function (value) <p>Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic     escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped.</p> select function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object,     and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding.</p> selectattr function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified     attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the     test succeeding.</p> slice function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing     those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing     three ul tags that represent columns.</p> sort function (environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func) <p>Sort an iterable using Python's :func:<code>sorted</code>.</p> string builtin_function_or_method <p>Convert an object to a string if it isn't already. This preserves a :class:<code>Markup</code> string rather than converting it back to a basic string, so it will still be marked as safe and won't be escaped again.</p> striptags function (value) <p>Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space.</p> sum function (args, kwargs, b) <p>Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter     'start' (which defaults to 0).  When the sequence is empty it returns     start.</p> title function (s) <p>Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with     uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase.</p> trim function (value, chars) <p>Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace.</p> truncate function (env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result) <p>Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified     with the first parameter which defaults to <code>255</code>. If the second     parameter is <code>true</code> the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise     it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact     truncated it will append an ellipsis sign (<code>\"...\"</code>). If you want a     different ellipsis sign than <code>\"...\"</code> you can specify it using the     third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance     margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated.</p> unique function (environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key) <p>Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable.</p> upper function (s) <p>Convert a value to uppercase.</p> urlencode function (value, items) <p>Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8.</p> urlize function (eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, extra_schemes, policies, rel_parts, scheme, rv) <p>Convert URLs in text into clickable links.</p> wordcount function (s) <p>Count the words in that string.</p> wordwrap function (environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens) <p>Wrap a string to the given width.

The inventory is anchored by ManagedCluster.v1.cluster.open-cluster-management.io objects that describe the WECs. For each WEC there may also be a <code>ConfigMap</code> object (in the <code>customization-properties</code> namespace) that carries additional properties of that WEC; this <code>ConfigMap</code> is used in customizing the workload to the WEC. The mailbox namespaces and their contents are transport implementation details that users do not need to deal with. Each mailbox namespace corresponds 1:1 with a WEC and holds <code>ManifestWork</code> objects managed by the central KubeStellar controllers.</p> <p>A WDS holds user workload objects and the user's objects that form the interface to KubeStellar control.

In Open Cluster Management, spoke clusters  are called managed clusters, and the component running on the hub cluster is the cluster manager. Manifests provide a summary for the status of each object, however in some use  cases this might not be sufficient as the full status for objects may be required.  OCM provides an add-on framework that allows to automatically install additional  agents on the managed clusters to provide specific features.

The cluster will be accepted by the hub control plane if the CSR is approved and  signed by any certificate provider setting filling <code>.status.certificate</code> with legit  X.509 certificates, and the ManagedCluster resource is approved by setting  <code>.spec.hubAcceptsClient</code> to true in the spec. Upon approval, the registration  agent observes the signed certificate and persists them as a local secret  named <code>hub-kubeconfig-secret</code> (by default in the <code>open-cluster-management-agent</code> namespace)  which will be mounted to the other fundamental components of klusterlet such as  the work agent. The registration process in OCM is called double opt-in mechanism,  which means that a successful cluster registration requires both sides of approval  and commitment from the hub cluster and the managed cluster.</p> <p>The work agent monitors the <code>ManifestWork</code> resource in the cluster namespace  on the hub cluster.

The work agent checks whether a resource is Available,  meaning the resource exists on the managed cluster, and Applied, meaning the resource  defined in ManifestWork has been applied to the managed cluster. To ensure the resources  applied by ManifestWork are reliably recorded, the work agent creates an <code>AppliedManifestWork</code>  on the managed cluster for each ManifestWork as an anchor for resources relating to ManifestWork.

OCM transport plugin implements the above interface and supplies a function to start the transport controller using the specific OCM implementation. Code is available here. We expect to have more transport plugin options in the future.</p> <p>The following section describes how transport controller works, while the described behavior remains the same no matter which transport plugin is selected. The high level flow for the transport controller is described in Figure 5.</p> <p> Figure 5 - Transport Controller </p> <p>The transport controller is driven by <code>Binding</code> objects in the WDS. There is a 1:1 correspondence between <code>Binding</code> objects and <code>BindingPolicy</code> objects, but the transport controller does not care about the latter. A <code>Binding</code> object contains (a) a list of references to workload objects that are selected for distribution and (b) a list of references to the destinations for those workload objects.</p> <p>The transport controller watches for <code>Binding</code> objects on the WDS, using an informer. Upon every add, update, and delete event from that informer, the controller puts a reference to that <code>Binding</code> object in its work queue. The transport controller also has informers on the inventory objects (both <code>ManagedCluster</code> and their associated <code>ConfigMap</code>) and on the wrapped objects (<code>ManifestWork</code>). Forked goroutines process items from the work queue. For a reference to a control or workload object, that processing starts with retrieving the informer's cached copy of that object. </p> <p>The transport controller also maintains a finalizer on each Binding object. When processing a reference to a <code>Binding</code> object that no longer exists, the transport controller has nothing more to do (because it processes the deletion before removing its finalizer).</p> <p>When processing a reference to a <code>Binding</code> object that still exists, the transport controller looks at whether that <code>Binding</code> is in the process of being deleted. If so then the controller ensures that the corresponding wrapped object (<code>ManifestWork</code>) in the ITS no longer exists and then removes the finalizer from the <code>Binding</code>.</p> <p>When processing a <code>Binding</code> object that is not being deleted, the transport controller first ensures that the finalizer is on that object. Then the controller constructs an internal function from destination to the customized wrapped object for that destination. The controller then iterates over the <code>Binding</code>'s list of destinations and propagates the corresponding wrapped object (reported by the function just described) to the corresponding mailbox namespace.  Once the wrapped object is in the mailbox namespace of a cluster on the ITS, it's the agent responsibility to pull the wrapped object from there and apply/update/delete the workload objects on the WEC.</p> <p>To construct the function from destination to customized wrapped object, the transport controller reads the <code>Binding</code>'s list of references to workload objects. The controller reads those objects from the WDS using a Kubernetes \"dynamic\" client. Immediately upon reading each workload object, the controller applies the WEC-independent transforms (from the <code>CustomTransform</code> objects). After doing that for all the listed workload objects, the controller goes through those objects one-by-one and applies template expansion for each destination if the object requests template expansion. If any of those objects requests template expansion and has a string that actually involves template expansion: the controller accumulates a map from destination to slice of customized objects and then invokes the transport plugin on each of those slices, to ultimately produce the function from destination to wrapped object. If none of the selected workload objects actually involved any template expansion then the controller wraps the slice of workload objects to get one wrapped object and produces a constant function from destination to that one wrapped object. </p> <p>Transport controller is based on the controller design pattern and aims to bring the current state to the desired state. If a WEC was removed from the <code>Binding</code>, the transport controller will also make sure to remove the matching wrapped object(s) from the WEC's mailbox namespace.</p>"},{"location":"direct/architecture/#custom-transform-cache","title":"Custom transform cache","text":"<p>To support efficient application of the <code>CustomTransform</code> objects, the transport controller maintains a cache of the results of internalizing what the users are asking for.

We do not need to support anything like full SQL (for any version of SQL). This proposal only involves one particular pattern of relatively simple SELECT statement, and a small subset of the expression language.</p> </li> <li> <p>The specification of how to combine reported state is defined in <code>StatusCollector</code> objects. These objects are referenced in the BindingPolicies right next to the criteria for selecting workload objects. This saves users the trouble of having to write selection criteria twice. With the specification being separate, it is possible to have a library of <code>StatusCollectors</code> that can be reused across different BindingPolicies.

This means that the associated semantics are followed, in terms of what sort of changes to the repo require what sort of changes to the release identifier.</li> <li>A user can pick up and use a given existing release without being perturbed by on-going contributor work. A release is an immutable thing.</li> <li>A release with a given semver identifier is built from a commit of this Git repository tagged with a tag whose name is \"v\" followed by the release identifier.</li> <li>The contents of <code>main</code> always work. This includes passing CI tests. This includes documentation being accurate. We allow point-in-time specific documentation, such as a document that says \"Here is how to use release 1.2.3\" --- which would refer to a release made in the past. We do not require the documentation in <code>main</code> to document all releases.</li> <li>A git tag is immutable. Once associated with a given Git commit, that association is not changed later.</li> <li>We do not put self-references into Git. For example, making release <code>1.2.3</code> does not require changing any file in Git to have the string <code>1.2.3</code> in it.</li> </ul> <p>We have the following limitations.</p> <ul> <li>The only way to publish artifacts (broadly construed, not (necessarily) GitHub \"release artifacts\") is to make a release.</li> <li>The only way to test published artifacts is to make a release and test it.</li> <li>Thus, it is necessary to keep users clearly appraised of the quality (or status of evaluating the quality) of each release.</li> <li>Because of the lack of self references, most user instructions (e.g., examples) and tests do not have concrete release identifiers in them; instead, the user has to chose and supply the release identifier. There can also be documentation of a specific past release (e.g., the latest stable release) that uses the literal identifier for that past release.</li> <li>PAY ATTENTION TO THIS ONE: Because of the prohibition of self references, Git will not contain the exact bytes of our Helm chart definitions. Where a Helm chart states its own version or has a container image reference to an image built from the same release, the bytes in Git have a placeholder for that image's tag and the process of creating the published release artifacts fills in that placeholder. Think of this as being analogous to the linking done when building a binary executable file.</li> <li>The design below falls short of the goal of not putting self-references in files under Git control.

Errors during template expansion usually produce broken YAML, in which case no corresponding object will be created in the WEC.</p> <p>The data used when expanding the template are properties of the WEC.
